    "This trial is to see how well the model performs on Baillon's (2020) dataset. I will be using a merge of these datasets that was input in the BERT model used on Google Colab for this project (fake and true combined). As I was not able to complete the full training on the BERT model for the full set of text, so I will implement this with only the titles. This will also enable me to see how accurately the LSTM model is on a small sets of data and how long the model runs for in comparison to the full text data the LSTM model was initially trained on. \n",
